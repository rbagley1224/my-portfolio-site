            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey, I'm Riley Bagley — a self-taught web developer passionate about building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript out of curiosity, and it quickly turned into a full-blown passion. I love turning creative ideas into real projects that help people and businesses stand out online.</p>
            <p>I've been building projects that show off both the technical side of coding and the design aspect — because a website shouldn't just function, it should feel great to use. Whether it's a portfolio site, small business landing page, or a creative concept, I enjoy the process from start to finish.</p>
            <p>Outside of coding, I'm into photography, videography, and storytelling. I've spent time creating travel videos, working on short films, and capturing moments that inspire. I'm from a small town, and I carry that grounded mindset with me into everything I create — whether it's a personal project or work for a client.</p>
            <p>Right now, I'm focused on sharpening my front-end skills with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and starting to integrate React into my workflow. I also enjoy learning about UI/UX design, accessibility, and animation to create smooth, engaging experiences for users.</p>
            <p>If you're looking for someone who can bring creativity, attention to detail, and a strong work ethic to your project — let's connect. Whether you're a brand, a small business, or someone with a cool idea, I'd love to help bring your vision to life.</p>
