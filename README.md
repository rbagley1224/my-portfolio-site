# my-portfolio-site
This is a personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes smooth scroll animations and simple interactive features designed to showcase some of the front-end development skills I've learned. The layout is clean and responsive, intended to serve as both a creative sandbox and a professional introduction.
